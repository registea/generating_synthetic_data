# Introduction

To apply analytics and data science principles, it is necessary to have access to data. There are many places where data is freely available, some examples are:

* Kaggle
* Wiki
* Data.gov

There are instances where open source doesn't meet your precise data needs. In these scenarios, it could be the perfect opportunity to generate synthetic data, which can be built and structured to your exact requirements. 

This post is going to use base R with a little help from the tidyverse, to demonstrate how a simple customer dataset can be generated. R provides access to popular theoretical probability distributions and allows us to sample values from them. Futher to this, there is also functionality to sample from an empirical distribution. Utilising these two types of distributions, makes it very easy to generate data.

In this notebook, a dataset will be generated for 1 million customers. For each customer, data will be created to represent socio-demographics and sales information.
